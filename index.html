As a journalist you may be assigned general news topics or you may work in various specialty areas such as politics, celebrity news or sports. Much of your job will involve traveling to local or distant destinations to gather <strong>information</strong> for a story. You may have to interview people to gather facts or get firsthand accounts of an event. Deadlines are a regular part of the job, and <strong>journalists</strong> frequently work odd hours and weekends.</p>
